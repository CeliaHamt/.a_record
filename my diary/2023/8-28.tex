    Supposed that $| \cdot |$ is a non-arch discreate valution. Donate the integral elements ring as $\mathfrak{o}$ , the maximal ideal as $\mathfrak{p}$ . Specially, we require the residue field $\mathfrak{o} \backslash \mathfrak{p}$ is finite with $P$ elements (then its multiplication group is a cyclic group with order $P-1$. By Hensel's Lemma, we can assume the generator is in the field $k$, as a (none 1) root of $f(X) = X^{P-1} - 1$ )

    in this case, we have an important topological thm:

    \begin{theorem}
        in addition, we require $k = \bar{k}$, then $\mathfrak{o}$ is compact in $k$
    \end{theorem}

    we can easily write down the Haar measure of $k^+$ and $k^{\times}$

    the most interesting fact is that, as long as the k is complete, the normed spaces is unique !!!
